You're looking at a very crude, purely black and white hand-drawn map.
Countries are labelled by their two-letter country codes.
The map is missing a lot of details. Borders aren't accurately drawn, but the relationships (cardinal directions, which countries border which other countries) should be present. 

List every country you've recognized by its two-letter country code.
Evaluate how accurately it's placed relative to its neighbors (bordering the right countries, placed in the right cardinal direction to each other).
